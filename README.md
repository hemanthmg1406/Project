## **Setup Instructions**
### **Prerequisites**
1. Install Python (3.6 or later) and the following libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib numpy
Model Accuracy
Model	      Accuracy (Train)	Accuracy (Validation)
CNN	        99%          97%
VGG16	      95%	         93%
ResNet50	  80%	         70%
Sample Output
Case 1: Family Member Detected
Output: Access Granted! Welcome Home, [Name]!
Case 2: Stranger Detected
Output: Access Denied. Sorry, you are not recognized as a family member.
