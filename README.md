# Smart Video Detection: Deep Learning for Enhanced Home Security

## Project Overview
The **Smart Video Detection** project leverages deep learning to perform real-time **facial recognition** for **access control** in home security systems. This project uses a variety of **pre-trained models** (CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50) to detect and classify faces in video feeds, granting or denying access based on recognition.

The project aims to provide an intelligent and automated solution for recognizing authorized individuals and controlling access based on facial features.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Detect and classify faces in a video feed.
- **Access Control**: Grant or deny access based on recognized faces.
- **Multiple Models**: Trained models (CNN, VGG16, ResNet50) for high accuracy.
- **Video Input**: Process videos for face detection and classification.
- **Real-time Classification**: Predict the identity of faces in real-time.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.6+**
- **Google Colab** (if running in the cloud) or **Local Python Environment** (if running on your machine)
- **Git** for version control

### Installing Dependencies
Before running the project, install the required dependencies. You can install all required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
Running the Scripts
Training the Models: You can train the models using the provided scripts. For example, to train the CNN model, run:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_cnn.py
This will use your dataset to train the CNN-based model. You can also train the VGG16 and ResNet50 models by running their respective scripts:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_vgg16.py
python scripts/train_resnet50.py
The trained models will be saved in the models/ folder.

Face Detection and Access Control: To process a video feed and classify faces, run the video detection script:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/video_detection.py
The script will process the video, detect faces, and classify them based on the trained model. It will display:

"ACCESS GRANTED! Welcome Home, [Name]" for recognized faces.
"ACCESS DENIED" for unrecognized or unknown faces.
Dataset: Ensure that the dataset is stored in the dataset/ folder. The dataset should have the following structure:

markdown
Copy code
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ user1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg(upto n-1 inputs)
â”œâ”€â”€ user2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg(upto n-1 inputs)
â””â”€â”€ user3/
    â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg(upto n-1 inputs)
Dataset and Models:

The models/ folder contains the saved models after training.
The dataset/ folder contains images for training the models (for example, images of family members).

Future Work / Improvements
Improve Accuracy: Collect more training data and experiment with hyperparameters.
Real-time Detection: Deploy this system on a Raspberry Pi or another device for real-time face recognition and access control.
Multi-Face Detection: Extend the system to handle multiple faces in a single video frame.
Web Interface: Develop a web-based interface to allow remote monitoring and access control.
